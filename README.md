## Introduction
The JFlex project is a lexical analyzer generator for Java. It is used to generate Java code that recognizes and tokenizes input strings based on specified regular expressions.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of JFlex from the official website.
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a desired location on your machine.
3. Set up the JFlex environment variables, if necessary.

## Usage
To generate a lexer using JFlex, follow these steps:
1. Create a `.flex` file containing the lexer specification.
2. Run JFlex on the `.flex` file to generate the Java lexer code.
3. Include the generated Java lexer code in your project.
4. Use the lexer code to tokenize input strings.
